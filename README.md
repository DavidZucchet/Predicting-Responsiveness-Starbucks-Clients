# Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using the data provides by Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disastes messages and can send them to an appropriate disaster relief agency.

# File Descriptions
There is 3 folders containing the data, models and the app. 
The Data folder contains 2 CSV files with the raw data. The python file "process_data.py" has the code for extract, transform, clean and load the data.
The models folder contains a python file "train_classifier.py". When executing this code it splits the data into a training set and a test set. Then, it creates a machine learning pipeline that uses NLTK, as well as scikit-learn's Pipeline and RandomSearchCV (RandomizedSearchCV is used instead of GridSearchCV because sacrifice in precision and accuracy is not huge in relation to processing time and finding best parameters) to output a final model that uses the message column to predict classifications for 36 categories (multi-output classification). Finally, it exports the model to a pickle file.
The app folder contains a python file "run.py" that use the database and the model, and generate a web app using flask that displays data visualization and classify messages. It also has a folder with 2 html files for generating the web app. 
Comments were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

# Results

### Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/

The results of the model can be found at the web app.

Must give credit to Figure Eight for the data and Udacity for the learning path in the DataScientist Course and some of the code that I reused. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
